This tutorial gives an introduction to the IPython interactive shell for 
exploratory computing with python. In order to follow along with the tutorial,
you must have at least the following four packages installed:

1) python
2) ipython
3) numpy
4) matplotlib

For instructions on how to install these packages on your platform, see:
http://ipython.org/install.html

The tutorial uses a data set, stored in rawSignals.txt, as a basis for showing
off some of the utilities of IPython. A cleaned-up and commented log of the 
ipython session created during the live tutorial will be added afterwards.
