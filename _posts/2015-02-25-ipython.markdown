## Omoju Miller

[Omoju Miller](http://omojumiller.com) is a PhD candidate at the University of
California at Berkeley researching artificial intelligence. She is also a
software technologist, start-up advisor, and educator.


## IPython

IPython is an interactive interpreter for programming with Python (and now many
other languages).

### Easy, Peasy, Lemon Squeezy

Omoju suggests that, to work, teach, or collaborate, development tools need to
be as easy as possible to install and use.

Things that she mentioned in this regard:

- IPython is easy to install with "pip." Just type `pip install ipython` in the
  terminal.
- [Wakari.io](http://wakari.io)
- [NBViewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org)

### The IPython Notebook

To start up the ipython notebook, crack open your terminal and type:

```
ipython notebook
```

That starts up a server which serves ipython notebookes (usually to
localhost:8888 or similar). This command, therefore, will automatically open a
browser instance with a view of your directory. This will allow you to open up
any ipython notebooks in that directory. It also allows you (with a button) to
create a new notebook in that directory.

#### The Oscars

Omoju showed an example from [Mining the Social
Web](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition/tree/master/ipynb/)
about using the twitter api. She demonstrated how she was able to use the
ipython notebook to access the twitter firehose and filter out tweets
concerning the Academy awards.

#### LaTeX in Markdown cells

She demonstrated also how to include LaTeX in a markdown cell. First, create a
markdown cell, then include math:

```
Courtesy of MathJax, you can include mathematical expressions both inline:
$e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$  and displayed:

$$e^x=\sum_{i=0}^\infty \frac{1}{i!}x^i$$
```

#### Using IPython Notebooks with GitHub

A troublesome issue with IPython notebooks is the extra information that is
held in the json. That doesn't version control as beautifully as plain text.

To avoid extra headaches, clear all output cells (Cell - > All Output - >
Clear) before you commit your ipython notebooks.

#### Magics in the Notebooks

Omoju describes these as Development Powertools.
[Magics](http://ipython.org/ipython-doc/dev/interactive/tutorial.html) are special tools and
functions. They are often preceeded by one or more percent signs (%). Some examples:

- %timeit : times the execution of a function
- %%timeit : times the execution of a whole cell
- %%javascript : allows the use of javascript code in the notebook

#### Plotly Notebook Examples

Plotly is a plotting tool. On their websites, there are some fun examples in
the gallery of IPython notebooks .

#### Use Cases

Omoju suggests using IPython notebooks for lots of stuff, including:

- Code Mentoring
- Teaching
- Data Analysis
- Writing Books

### Learning more with Books

Omoju recommends [The Ipython Cookbook](http://ipython-books.github.io/cookbook).

## Lightning Talks

### Martin Magdinier : OpenRefine

[OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) is a tool for helping to clean and process
data. You can do this with very limited data processing skills, but it is also
useful for more skilled analysts.

Refine runs a local java-based server on your local machine and it opens up a
browser instance to provide an interface for loading data, parsing it,
identifying close duplicate categories, cleaning it up, and exploring it
somewhat with filters and views.


### Brian Hamlin : Geospatial stuff!

Geospatial data is everywhere.  An example is found at
[www.pism-docs.org](http://www.pism-docs.org)

- **Does anyone know how to export NetCDF -> text**
- **Does anyone who uses Pandas or GeoPandas know how to join-on-attribute and
  get a GeoPandas object rather than a Pandas object?**

### Daniel Wooten : Prompt Magic

Dan Wooten uses SSH to get to computers all over the place. He likes to be able
to tell what computer he is on simply by the color of the prompt in his
terminal.

In the .bashrc file, you can export a modified PS1 variable to change the
content and color of your prompt.

BUT, the code necesary for specifying the right thing is pretty hideous. Let
someone else figure out the syntax for you with : [PROMPT
MAGIC!!!](http://www.funtoo.org/Prompt_Magic)
